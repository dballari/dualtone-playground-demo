# DualTone theme playground demo

DualTone playground demo with user patterns.
It's a Work in progressâ€”demo content has no yet been finished

Created thanks to Ronny's post on [how to use playground](https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2024/04/25/how-to-use-wordpress-playground-for-interactive-demos/)
and thanks to Nick's post on [overrides in synced patterns](https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2024/06/18/an-introduction-to-overrides-in-synced-patterns/).

While [Nick's playground demo](https://playground.wordpress.net/?blueprint-url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wptrainingteam/developer-blog-playground-demos/main/synced-pattern-overrides/blueprint.json) is for advanced WordPress users to teach how to allow overrides, these playground demos are also for end users to explore the theme.
