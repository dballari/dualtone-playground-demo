# DualTone theme playground demo

DualTone playground demo with some user patterns and menus.

Created thanks to Ronny's post on [how to use playground](https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2024/04/25/how-to-use-wordpress-playground-for-interactive-demos/)
and thanks to Nick's post on [overrides in synced patterns](https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2024/06/18/an-introduction-to-overrides-in-synced-patterns/).

While [Nick's playground demo](https://playground.wordpress.net/?blueprint-url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wptrainingteam/developer-blog-playground-demos/main/synced-pattern-overrides/blueprint.json) is for advanced WordPress users to teach how to allow overrides, these playground demos are also for end users to explore the theme.

More information and blueprint examples may be found in the [WordPress Blueprints Community Gallery repo](https://github.com/WordPress/blueprints/).
